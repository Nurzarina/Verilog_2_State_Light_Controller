# Light Controller FSM

This project implements a simple Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog for a light controller that toggles the light state based on button presses. The FSM has two states: `ON` and `OFF`, controlled by a button input and a reset signal.

## Features

- Simple FSM implementation with two states.
- Asynchronous reset functionality.
- Responsive to button presses.

## Tools Used

- **Verilog**: The hardware description language used for designing the D Flip-Flop.
- **Icarus Verilog**: A simulator for Verilog code.
- **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer to visualize the simulation results.
- **Docker**: Used to create a consistent development environment.
- **VS Code**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding.
